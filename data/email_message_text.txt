Hello STEMninjas Family,

PLEASE READ THIS EMAIL IN ITS ENTIRETY.

This email contains a revised policy for Class Continuation. It also contains information regarding the method of donation.

IF YOU HAVE NOT ALREADY DONE SO, please fill out the form for continuing classes (https://forms.gle/PPs29uBqFPRHQ6sG8). 

The donation is now **OPTIONAL**. You are NOT required to make a donation in order to continue classes. We have realized that this goes against our mission and goal, and have decided to make any donation optional. Nevertheless, we highly encourage all of you to consider donating around $10 to help fund the program. We are currently 501(c)(3) pending, and will let you know when we receive 501(c)(3) status so that your donations will be tax-deductible. The link to donate can be found on our website under "Donate" or you can use the following link: https://www.stemninjas.org/donate . Once again, we will be grateful for any donation made to STEMninjas, whether you are continuing classes or not. 

REMINDER: All donations will be going towards improving class quality, covering operational costs, website maintenance, etc., so a donation to STEMninjas is a contribution to helping your community!

We will also be sending out more emails regarding our LATEST and EXCLUSIVE Engineering Opportunity (https://www.stemninjas.org/ninjascreate-junior) intended for students who WERE/WILL be in grades K-5 (which means students who are going to 6th grade are eligible too). So look out for that!

If you have not already join our Facebook Page and Group at https://fb.me/STEMninjas, follow us on Instagram @stemninjas, or follow us on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/company/stemninjas.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.

Sincerely,
The STEMninjas Executive Team
